## 🔍 Search Tips

### Basic Search
Just type in the search box! It searches:
- Titles
- Descriptions
- Code content
- Tags
- Subjects
- Error messages

### Filter While Searching
1. Type your search
2. Use the dropdowns:
   - Language (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
   - Subject (Algorithms, Web Dev, etc.)
   - Sort by (Date, Title, Most Copied)

## 🐛 When You Get an Error

### The Ryana Way (Do This!)
1. Click "+ Log Error"
2. Paste your broken code
3. Copy/paste the error message
4. Write how you fixed it
5. Add links to Stack Overflow/docs
6. Tag it: `error`, `[language]`, `[concept]`

### The Old Way (Don't Do This)
